# About the Workshop
Land models urgently need to be confronted with a wide range of data to optimize model parameters, initialize surface states, and to address model structural uncertainty. In 2021, the AIMES Working Group on Land Data Assimilation initiated a regular annual meeting to bring together the land surface modeling groups working on data assimilation challenges from both the ESM and NWP communities. Technical challenges are the focus of these annual meetings as the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments are typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. To strengthen communication between modeling groups, this workshop will bring together land DA scientists to highlight a range of DA methods used within the community, discuss challenges facing different modeling communities, and identify strategies for addressing those challenges. We welcome participation from a broad range of research interests including land surface states and fluxes (carbon, energy, and water cycles to crop, fire, and land management), timescales (daily, seasonal to subseasonal, centennial/millennial), and scientific and practical applications (improving understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks, weather prediction, agricultural forecasting, and climate change impacts). The outcome of this workshop is to increase collaboration and coordination within the land DA community to tackle technical challenges and promote the routine use of DA tools in the wider modeling community. We seek to strengthen connections between land DA communities, increase knowledge exchange to tackle land DA challenges, and build a collaborative land DA community inclusive of all backgrounds and career stages. To learn more about the outcomes of previous workshops, please check out the following: MacBean et al., (2022) [https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0228.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0228.1) and Kumar et al., (2022) [https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003259](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003259).   

The goals of the workshop are to: 
1. Foster knowledge exchange across all groups working in land data assimilation
2. Build a community of practice and collaboration for researchers working in land DA, particularly for addressing the technical challenges we face while developing land DA systems.

Talks in this workshop will place greater weight on addressing the technical challenges associated with developing land DA systems than answering the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments, which is typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. The following themes will be explored in this year’s workshop:
- Land data assimilation in CMIP7
- Machine learning in land DA research and applications
- Including novel observations and processes in land DA systems
- Bridging the gap between methodological development and applications of DA in NWP and ESMs
- Community updates
